#MERN-Stack Infrastructure

Clone this repo to provide the starter code for a future MERN-Stack Project


Here’s the process to create a new MERN-Stack project that starts with the infrastructure code:

Clone the mern-infrastructure repo:

 git clone <url of mern-infrastructure> <name-of-project>
👀 The folder created will be same as <name-of-project> instead of mern-infrastructure

cd <name-of-project>

Install the Node modules: npm i

Create a .env (touch .env) and add entries for DATABASE_URL and SECRET

Update the "name": "mern-infrastructure" in package.json to the name of your project.

Build the React code to create the build folder, otherwise the Express server will not start up: npm run build

Create a new repo on your personal GH account.

Copy the new GH repo’s URL.

Update the remote’s URL:
 git remote set-url origin <paste the copied GH url>
Make the initial commit:
git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push for the first time:
git push -u origin main
Remember that the Express server won’t start without error until the build folder used by Express is created by running:

npm run build
Have fun coding your new project and don’t forget to make frequent commits!
